				<p class="Some_Words">
					My name is Meldin Kajoshaj and I am  student at The College of New York. I am a junior pursing 
					a Bachelors of Engineering in Computer Engineering. In my spare time I try to work on side projects that
					interest me and spend as much time with family and friends as I can.<br><br>
					Having an older brother that was into technology made me gravitate towards it while growing up. So, when choosing a 
					major for college, I thought it was a no brainer at the time. I started coding my freshman year and I knew since then 
					it was something I wanted to persue for a career.

              <p class="Some_Words1">
					<strong>CUNY IBM Watson Social Impact Challenge</strong> - Worked on a team of 4 that proposed to decrease parking 
					search times by using machine learning models that would give drivers information about the parking 
					conditions around a desired destination. Created a one-page proposal explaining our idea in the first
					round followed by a three-page business case analysis, a 1-min video in the next round, followed by
					a five-minute presentation in front of a panel of judges as a top 10 finalist<br><br>
					
					<strong>SkinSight, BrickHack V Hackathon</strong> - Worked in a team of 3 to create a web-based application using 
					an IBM Watson Visual Recognition model to allow users to detect the early stages of carcinoma and melanoma. 
					Implemented our Visual Recognition model using Python API calls, which recognizes carcinoma and melanoma with 92%
					accuracy, and malignancy within 80.2%, allowing users to upload an image of their suspected skin lesion. Trained 
					model using the HAM10000 dataset of categorized skin conditions and lesions.<br><br>
					
					<strong>Company Database</strong> - Built database using MySQL which records company information such as employee names, 
					job titles, salaries, social security numbers, etc. Created a user interface using Java that allowed the 
					user to modify, insert, or delete information from the database.

              <p class="Some_Words1">
				Whenever I have free time, I try to spend that time with family friends. 
				Sometimes that means playing basketball or raquetball, grabbing a bite to eat, or just 
				enjoying their company. Spending time with the people I love is something I feel to be super important
				as I find it to be thereputic. It makes the rough times not as rough and it makes the great times even greater <br><br>
