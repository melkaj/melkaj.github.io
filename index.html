                            My name is <strong>Meldin Kajoshaj</strong> and I am  student at The College of New York. I am a junior pursing 
                            a Bachelors of Engineering in Computer Engineering. In my spare time I try to work on side projects that
                            interest me and spend as much time with family and friends as I can.<br><br>
                            Getting out of high school I chose to get into technology because my older brother was already in the field. 
                            But I stayed because I saw how impactful it can be. At the first hackathon I attended, we were encouraged to 
                            dream big and have big goals so, my partner and I created a tool that analyzed skin lesions and determined 
                            if it was cancerous or not using IBM Watson Recognition Models â€“ a tool we never used before. 
                            And besides having a passion for programming, what drives me is working on projects like this; 
                            Projects that can positively affect lives and can help society for the better.

                                <strong>CUNY IBM Watson Social Impact Challenge</strong> - Worked on a team of 4 that proposed to decrease parking 
                                search times by using machine learning models that would give drivers information about the parking 
                                conditions around a desired destination. Created a one-page proposal explaining our idea in the first
                                round followed by a three-page business case analysis, a 1-min video in the next round, followed by
                                a five-minute presentation in front of a panel of judges as a top 10 finalist

                                <strong>SkinSight, BrickHack V Hackathon</strong> - Worked in a team of 3 to create a web-based application using 
                                an IBM Watson Visual Recognition model to allow users to detect the early stages of carcinoma and melanoma. 
                                Implemented our Visual Recognition model using Python API calls, which recognizes carcinoma and melanoma with 92%
                                accuracy, and malignancy within 80.2%, allowing users to upload an image of their suspected skin lesion. Trained 
                                model using the HAM10000 dataset of categorized skin conditions and lesions.
